# TASKS.md — Open Work
> Active branch `sendrow-v3` (CRM reshape). Plans in flight: Y (CRM/MVP-for-pilots), D (Azoulay demo prep), X (demo-feedback fixes — built). UI spec: `docs/wireframes-2026-07-13.md`. Completed: A–N, T, U1–U2, W1–W2 — history in git. Bugs section above is the live "what's broken" list.

## BUGS — everything that doesn't work (audited 2026-07-21, updated 2026-07-23, branch `sendrow-v3`)
> Method: static route/link audit + live page-by-page sweep of all 34 routes + mutation pass, all driven against real demo data (temporary dev-only auth bypass, reverted each time). Every page returns HTTP 200 with no JS errors EXCEPT where noted. Severity: P0 blocks a demo, P1 real bug, P2 polish/cleanup, BLOCKED needs env/user to even test.

**Fixed on v3 (2026-07-21 → 07-23)**
- [x] **BUG-2 (FIXED)** — `/consultant/review` was orphaned BUT two notification emails linked to it → consultants landed on a stale page. Repointed `sendClientStuckEmail` → client detail (reply box, passes companyId), `sendUploadNeedsReviewEmail` (dead fn) → dashboard; deleted `app/consultant/review/`.
- [x] **BUG-3 (FIXED)** — Added `app/consultant/loading.tsx` + `clients/[id]/loading.tsx` skeletons (cover all consultant pages). No more blank-screen gap; verified live.
- [x] **BUG-5 (FIXED)** — Trailing scroll spacer on the (now-reverted) board.
- [x] **BUG-8 (FIXED — found by mutation testing)** — Flag replies were write-only on the consultant side; the flag card now echoes "You replied: ..." with timestamps. Verified live.
- [x] **BUG-10 (FIXED — found by staging E2E)** — `/api/portal/import` used `file instanceof File`, but `File` is not a global on Node <20 → ReferenceError silently killed EVERY file upload on older runtimes (incl. local dev). Now duck-types the Blob (`typeof file !== "string"`). Prod (Node 20+) was unaffected but it was fragile.

**Still open**
- [ ] **BUG-9 (P1, correctness — found in QA) — diesel & propane are calculated with the GASOLINE factor.** `resolveFactorQuery` returns the same generic `{mobile_combustion, gallon}` query for any fuel, and `lookupFactor` returns the first match (gasoline 0.008887) regardless of diesel/propane. E.g. 400 gal diesel → app says 3554.80 kg, correct is 4084.00 kg (~13% understated). Fix: pass the specific fuel type through to the factor lookup. Small change, high value.
- [ ] **BUG-1 (P1)** — `/admin/factors` hangs ~15s + React hydration error before redirecting a non-admin to `/login`. Blocks real emission-factor entry (N7.2). Partly a keyless-dev artifact; investigate once ADMIN_CLERK_ID + prod Clerk are set.
- [ ] **BUG-4 (P2)** — Slow authenticated loads (dev, cold): client detail 4.3s, review 4.7s, manage 6.7s. Inflated by dev + Neon latency + sequential queries; BUG-3 loading states mask it, but a perf pass (parallelize queries) is still worth it. Re-measure on prod.
- [ ] **BUG-11 (P2, found in QA) — Excel serial dates.** Files opened/re-saved in Excel or Numbers convert dates like `2025-04` into serial numbers (`45657.66…`). Calcs are unaffected (quantity × factor), but date/period tagging is garbage. Fix: detect + convert Excel serials in the parser, or note "upload the raw CSV."

**Dead / disabled surfaces (harmless but confusing if a demo wanders in)**
- [ ] **BUG-6 (P2)** — QuickBooks API routes (`/api/auth/quickbooks/redirect|callback`) still exist though the UI was removed in Plan X4. Dead endpoints — remove or leave dormant (documented).
- [ ] **BUG-7 (P2)** — Payment gate is disabled (middleware comment), so `/checkout`, `/pricing`, `/pricing/agency` are reachable but non-functional. By design during dev, but pricing is deferred (GOALS.md) — make sure no demo path links into checkout.

**Could NOT verify — BLOCKED on env or would mutate prod data (not confirmed broken, just untested)**
- [ ] **BUG-B1 (BLOCKED)** — Email delivery (request link, reminders, flag reply, submission notice): Resend sending domain unverified, so all email is untested end-to-end. The "client gets a link" beat depends on it. Needs Malachi (Resend) — see D2.3.
- [ ] **BUG-B2 (BLOCKED)** — Evidence view/download: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` unset, so uploads are hash-only and the download route serves the "file not stored" page (Plan X made that honest, but real storage is untested). Needs Malachi (Vercel env) — see D2.2.
- [x] **BUG-B3 (VERIFIED 2026-07-23)** — Portal submission end-to-end driven live: upload file → mapping preview → confirm → stage → Submit all → line items land in the ledger (11 rows). Also confirmed the staging guarantee (ledger stayed empty while staged). Works.
- [~] **BUG-B4 (mostly verified)** — Mutation pass: **create request ✓, reply-to-flag ✓, approve-and-freeze ✓, share snapshot ✓, portal staged-submit ✓.** Still untested: create client, scope-2 override save, comment on line item. QA mutations cleaned via `reset-demo.ts` after each pass.

**Not bugs, but demo-prep gotchas**
- Seed dates are relative (`daysAgo` in reset-demo.ts): reseed the morning of any demo so dates read sensibly (D3.3). Last reseeded clean 2026-07-23.
- **QA test kit** in `~/Downloads/qa-A…D-*.csv` + `qa-combined.csv` — sample sheets with ground-truth CO2e (electricity/gas/fuel + edge cases). Upload `qa-combined.csv` to exercise everything in one item; diesel rows reveal BUG-9.

## Plan W — Wireframe Workflow Alignment

### W1 — Consultant IA shell + core-loop reshape — BUILT 2026-07-13
- [x] **W1.1** — Sidebar per wireframe (Dashboard / New request / Request templates / Format library / Compliance calendar / Settings)
- [x] **W1.2** — Dashboard #19: stat cards + client table (status · due · completeness) + `+ New request`
- [x] **W1.3** — StatusBadge, CompletenessMeter, StatCard (`components/workflow.tsx`) + `lib/client-status.ts` (11 tests)
- [x] **W1.4** — New Data Request page #1 (`/consultant/requests/new`) — template prefill, chips, cadence note, save-as-template, inline contact email
- [x] **W1.5** — Client Detail rebuild: stats row, requests → review/snapshot, event timeline, comment threads
- [x] **W1.6** — Engagement Templates page #23 (used-on count = matching request descriptions)
- [x] **W1.7** — Format Library page #35 (built-ins; add-new = honest W3 placeholder w/ interim path)
- [x] **W1.8** — Compliance Calendar page #44 (regulatory preloads + live request due dates)
- [x] **W1.9** — Chasing schedule page #21 (tier dates, sent log, pause/resume; age-based fallback shown)
- [x] **W1.10** — Settings #22 live email preview (name + accent update as you type)

### W2 — Review & Approve → Snapshot & Share — BUILT 2026-07-13
- [x] **W2.1** — Review & Approve page: category groups w/ files + threads, vendor confirm, session actions, dollar-fuel, ledger link
- [x] **W2.2** — `approveFreezeAndGo`: approves pending sessions → freezes snapshot → redirects to Snapshot & Share
- [x] **W2.3** — Open-flag warning modal (unmapped rows + stuck notes counted; approval logged w/ flags)
- [x] **W2.4** — Snapshot & Share page: 🔒 header, scope cards, format chips, share + receipts, correction note
- [ ] **W2.5** — Click-through verification with demo data (needs local Clerk login — Malachi)

### Y — MVP for pilots + CRM reshape (branch `sendrow-v3`; from 2026-07-21 meeting, PLANS.md Plan Y)
**Y1 — Pipeline board home — BUILT then REVERTED 2026-07-23**
- [x] **Y1.1** — `pipelineStage()` + `STAGE_META` + `isOverdue()` in `lib/client-status.ts` (5-stage derived; overdue = flag) + 7 unit tests. **Kept (unused after revert).**
- [x] **Y1.2** — `components/pipeline-board.tsx` (kanban columns + cards). **Kept (unused after revert).**
- [~] **Y1.3** — Board was live at `/consultant`, then **REVERTED to the old stat-cards + table** (Malachi preferred the old style, 2026-07-23). Delete added to client detail. Board code stays for an easy toggle-back.
- [x] **Y1.4** — Verified live: 3 seed clients landed in 3 columns (before revert).
- [ ] **Y1.5** — Deeper CRM client-detail reshape — NOT built (board reverted; revisit only if the board comes back).

**Y6 — Portal multi-file + batch-submit — BUILT 2026-07-23**
- [x] **Y6.1** — Multiple files per checklist item (up to `MAX_FILES_PER_CHECKLIST_ITEM = 12`): `fileCount` on ChecklistItem, cap enforced server + client, "+ Add another file (N of 12)" button. Verified live.
- [x] **Y6.2** — Batch-submit / true staging: confirmed files held client-side, sticky "Submit all N" bar with per-file remove, nothing reaches server/consultant until Submit. Verified live E2E (ledger empty while staged → data lands on submit). Tradeoff accepted: tab-close loses staged uploads.

**Y3 — Conversion P0 (highest leverage; not started)**
- [ ] **Y3.1** — Early-engagement reminder 48–72h after send (≤4 total touches)
- [ ] **Y3.2** — Checklist items + est. time inside the request email
- [ ] **Y3.3** — Per-item time estimates + overall progress on portal
- [ ] **Y3.4** — Named-buyer "why" framing in the request

**Y-discovery / research (Malachi-led or non-code)**
- [ ] **Y2** — Confirm supplier persona + consultant need via discovery (Berkeley net + Azoulay intros)
- [x] **Y4** — No emojis / em dashes verified across product UI (grep-clean)
- [ ] **Y5** — Data-asset research thread (not scoped)

### D — Azoulay demo prep (meeting next Thu ~2026-07-23; PLANNED 2026-07-16, no code started)
> Danielle Azoulay = founder, The CSO Shop (fractional sustainability consultancy; ex-L'Oreal USA CSR head, Columbia Climate School adjunct). She IS the ICP: a consultant running CPG/apparel client books. She will know SB 253 + GHG Protocol cold. Goal of meeting: design-partner interest, not just applause.

**D1 — Correctness she would catch (do first)**
- [x] **D1.1** — SB 253 date RESOLVED = **Nov 10, 2026** (Malachi confirmed 2026-07-21). Aligned: calendar page, GOALS/ROADMAP/NEXT/wireframes docs, deck already says Nov 10. (period.test.ts Aug-10 is unrelated fiscal-year test, left as-is.)
- [ ] **D1.2** — Real eGRID 2024 / USEEIO factor values via /admin/factors, or clearly label current factors as illustrative — she may check the math on screen (needs ADMIN_CLERK_ID env first)
- [ ] **D1.3** — Sanity-pass GHG terminology on visible screens (market- vs location-based, Scope 2 dual reporting, assurance = ISSA 5000)
- [ ] **D1.4** — SB 253 export chip: current output is a draft markdown — improve or label "draft pending CARB template" so it reads honest, not broken

**D2 — Ship + verify (the app she sees must be the fixed one)**
- [ ] **D2.1** — Deploy sendrow-v2 → main (Malachi decision; brings Plan X + emoji/em-dash sweep live; drizzle push adds nullable comment columns)
- [ ] **D2.2** — Vercel env: BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN (evidence view/download must work in demo), CRON_SECRET, ADMIN_CLERK_ID (Malachi)
- [ ] **D2.3** — Resend: verify sending domain so request/reply emails actually deliver (Malachi) — the "client gets a link" beat depends on it
- [ ] **D2.4** — Post-deploy QA: re-verify every [!] item in QA.md on production + full happy-path click-through (request → portal submit → flag/reply → review → approve → snapshot → share)

**D3 — Make the demo hers**
- [ ] **D3.1** — Add a demo client from her world to reset-demo.ts: a personal-care/apparel supplier (packaging or contract manufacturer) mid-flow — she should see her own client book, not logistics companies
- [ ] **D3.2** — White-label the demo workspace as a plausible consultancy (settings: name/accent) so portal + share pages show the consultant-brand story
- [ ] **D3.3** — Reseed + verify demo account morning-of (`npx tsx scripts/reset-demo.ts user_3GVr5Css8qERqxyWiySrhNeX3WF`)

**D4 — The meeting itself**
- [ ] **D4.1** — 5-click demo script anchored on her POV (dashboard → stuck client + reply → review w/ receipts → freeze → buyer view), rehearsed twice
- [ ] **D4.2** — Backup: 3-min screen recording of the same path in case wifi/login fails
- [ ] **D4.3** — Deck: date line current; consider a CPG-flavored example; PPTX is editable for tweaks
- [ ] **D4.4** — One-pager on her (CSO Shop services, sectors, her CSO-role thesis) + 5 questions to ask HER (where collection fails for her clients, which formats she answers most, would she pilot w/ 1–2 clients, pricing sanity, who else should see this)
- [ ] **D4.5** — The ask, decided in advance: design-partner pilot with 1–2 of her clients (free), feedback loop, intros to 3 consultants if it goes well

### X — Demo-feedback fixes (APPROVED 2026-07-14, QA.md Part 1 = triage)

- [x] **X3.5** — Scope 3 decision undo + low-confidence explanation tooltip (#11)
- [x] **X4.1** — Connections page deleted; nav/redirect/scope-page/email references cleaned; dormant lib/API code kept (#9)
- [x] **X4.2** — `/for-companies` rebuilt: one screen, get-matched funnel only (433 → 42 lines)
- [x] **X.extra** — All emojis removed from product UI (Malachi 2026-07-14); activity icons dropped, text labels instead
- [ ] **X.backlog** — Resend domain/key (Malachi) · env vars (Malachi) · "preflight checklist" + ledger "walkthrough link" repro (testers)
